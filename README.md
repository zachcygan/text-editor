# Text-Editor

## Description

My motivation for this project was to make a PWA that works offline and is downloaded on all devices from the website. This application allowed me to practice the unusual repo structure of a PWA and gave great experience using webpacks. This text editor is perfect for writing any kind of notes, but looks and works best with code.

## Installation

The webpage is available at https://github.com/zachcygan/text-editor. Be sure to install any dependencies by typing in "npm i" in the console. This will install express and mongoose. 

## Instructions

To begin installing the program, to be sure to type "npm i" inside the terminal to install any dependencies. To get the server running locally, type "npm run dev" inside the root of the application. This will start the application on your local machine on port 3001. Once the server is running, you may perfom CRUD operations on users, thoughts, and reactions mimicking a social media application.
